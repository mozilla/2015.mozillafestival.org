// Importing mofo-bootstrap.css inline seems redundant here since we already include that file in index.html.
// However, since mofo-bootstrap.css is built from SCSS and MozFest site uses LESS, this is the only way we can start utilizing mofo-bootstrap classes directly in these .less files. This way we can use those classes as mixins.
// e.g.,
// #foo {
//  .some-mofo-bootstrap-class;
// }
// Eventually we will want to use SCSS here and we should be able to easily import source files like
// @import '../node_modules/mofo-bootstrap/src/scss/file.scss';
