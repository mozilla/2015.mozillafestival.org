## Environment Variables
- `PORT` (optional)
- `PROPOSAL_SPREADSHEET_ID_2017`: Google Spreadsheet id that you are storing the proposal submissions to.
- `GOOGLE_API_CLIENT_EMAIL_2017`: Your [Google Service Account](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2ServiceAccount) client email created for MozFest.
- `GOOGLE_API_PRIVATE_KEY_2017`: The key associated with the client email.
- `GITHUB_BOT_TOKEN_2017`: [GitHub personal token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) you created for MozFest.
- `GITHUB_REPO_OWNER_2017`: The owner of the repo that you are posting the proposals to. e.g., if the repo is at https://github.com/MozillaFoundation/mozfest-program-2017 set `GITHUB_REPO_OWNER_2017` to `MozillaFoundation`.

## Localized proposal forms

MozFest site currently is only available in English. However, this year (2017) we offer proposal form in English(`/proposals`) plus three non-English languages - Spanish(`/proposals/espanol`), French(`/proposals/francais`), and German(`/proposals/deutsch)`. Note that there's no localization infrastructure in place that automatically pulls localized strings from an external resource. Localized strings and proposal pages are created manually:

1. clone `pages/proposals/language/english.json` and rename it to `newlanguage.json` with `newlanguage` being the language the strings are in. For consistency, make sure all letters are in lowercase. (e.g., `german.json`)

2. In `client.jsx`. Add the new key-value pair to the `LANGUAGE` object. For example:
```jsx
const LANGUAGE = {
  ...
  german: {
    name: `deutsch`, // this will be used as slug in the url (e.g., `/proposals/deutsch`)
    stringSource: require('./pages/proposals/language/german.json')
  }
};
```
The localized proposal page should be available on `/proposals/newlanguage`. (e.g., `/proposals/deutsch`)

3. Replace all the English strings in `newlanguage.json` with the localized strings. (**NOTE:** make sure the strings you are pasting in don't have scripts in them as these strings will be rendered as HTML without sanitization.)

4. In the `sendConfirmationEmail` function in`proposal-handler.js`, add the new `language: localecode` key-value pair to `localeMap`. Make sure the `localecode` matches what's on https://github.com/mozilla/webmaker-mailroom/tree/master/locale
e.g.,
```js
var localeMap = {
  ...
  "German": "de",
  ...
};
```
