        "MozFest sessions cover a wide range of topics, but share two important qualities: they are <em>interactive</em> and <em>inclusive</em>. Interactive as you want to be engaging and activating your participants from the beginning, and getting them making and doing, rather than listening and watching. Inclusive by welcoming all ages, all experience levels and disciplines to participate.",
        "Anyone may submit a proposal for MozFest 2018. Once you have submitted your session, it will enter an open curation process on <a href=\"https://github.com/MozillaFestival/mozfest-program-2018\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a>. All information you submit here, apart from email and Twitter handle will be seen publicly. We do encourage collaboration on GitHub, but it is not mandatory.",
        "Sessions may have anywhere from 3 to 25 participants, with a vast range of abilities and ages. Everyone at the festival is welcome to attend any and all of the sessions during the event",

        "Proposals are due August 1st. Once our dedicated team of Space Wranglers have had a chance to review each proposal we will contact individuals later in August.",
