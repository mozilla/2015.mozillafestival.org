              <p>MozFest brings together people who are open, friendly and eager to help. Participants of all ages and skill levels are welcome. We believe everyone has something to contribute. Youth especially are encouraged to come and lead sessions — we’re dedicated to mentoring and celebrating tomorrow’s leaders. For our youngest participants, on-site day care and activities are provided.</p>
              <p>We try to accommodate all interaction styles at MozFest. While many sessions are hands-on and fully interactive, we also have plenty of listening-based activities for those who participate best in that manner. We also feature individual maker stations where attendees can focus — individually or in a group — on a single activity.</p>
              <p>MozFest is proud to host attendees from all over the world. Because each of us arrives with different backgrounds, experiences and expectations, MozFest has <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/" target="_blank">Participation Guidelines</a> outlining how we interact. These are ground rules guiding how participants, facilitators, space wranglers, staff, volunteers and vendors engage with one another during the festival. Our goal is to make sure everyone can enjoy a safe, respectful and rewarding weekend.</p>

            <div className="two-column">
              <p>At MozFest, accessibility is a vital part building our inclusive community. From providing childcare to emphasizing language inclusion to ensuring people with disabilities are supported, we work hard to make sure every MozFest participant can engage with the people, spaces and themes of the festival.</p>
              <p>When you register to attend MozFest, please let us know if you have an accessibility need such as visual or auditory support, wheelchair access, or the need for a quiet space. We are committed to discussing attendees’ individual needs, and providing support to the best of our abilities.</p>
              <p>Making MozFest more accessible is an ongoing process. We welcome your suggestions and ideas and would like to learn from your experiences. Please <a href="mailto:festival@mozilla.org">contact us</a> for more information, or to ask for support.</p>
