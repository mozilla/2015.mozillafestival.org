          <p>Volunteers are integral to what we do at Mozilla, and MozFest is no different. The annual festival could not take place without the time, dedication and love of our local volunteers.</p>

          <p>Drawn from the local community, volunteers at MozFest do so much, from running the welcome desk and arranging swag bags to assisting press and helping with programming. We try to place people in roles they’re most interested in, and rotation of roles is encouraged. We provide training before the event, and we host several volunteer socials. Read more on our <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Mozfest/2017/Volunteers">volunteer wiki</a>.</p>

          <p>Volunteers are asked to share four hours of their time. As a thank you, we’ll cover the festival’s ticket cost. Volunteers also receive meals and a MozFest t-shirt. Unfortunately, we cannot cover travel to and from the event or provide accommodation.</p>
          
          <p>To apply, register for a (free) volunteer ticket <a href="https://ti.to/mozfestvolunteers/mozfest-volunteer-program-2017">here</a>. During the registration process, you'll have the opportunity to fill out a brief survey that will help us place you in a role suited to your needs and interests.</p>
